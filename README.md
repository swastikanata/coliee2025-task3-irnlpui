# UI-COLIEE 2025 â€“ Task 3: Statute Law Retrieval  

We participated in **Task 3: Statute Law Retrieval** of the Competition on Legal Information Extraction/Entailment (COLIEE) and submitted 3 runs with different approach.

| Run-ID        | One-line description                          |
| --------------| --------------------------------------------- |
| **UIthr**     | Selects legal articles with BM25 scores above a fixed threshold to balance precision and recall |
| **UIwa**      | Re-ranks BM25 results using LLMs for deeper semantic matching between questions and articles |
| **UImeta**    | Uses a logistic regression meta-classifier trained on multiple features to predict article relevance |

## 3. Data

The organizers provide the following datasets for training and evaluation:

- **Relevant Pairs (XML)**: Located in `data/train/`, this directory contains XML files with pairs of legal questions and their corresponding relevant articles.
- **Civil Code (TXT)**: The full English version of the civil code (Articles 1 to 724-2) is available at `data/civil_code_en-1to724-2.txt`.
